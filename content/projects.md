## Text Analysis of parliament speeches in German state parliaments

In my [master thesis](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y5j2u) I analyzed the parliament speeches given in the German State parliaments between 2008 and 2018. The time period covered varies between the states. My python code that converts the speeches into a machine-readable format is publicly [available][1]. I've have create a [dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/370V8H) where you can download the scraped speeches and interjections.

## [Guide for Toulouse][2]

I&#8217;ve created a guide for people who want to discover the City of Toulouse. The guide features the possibility to select a category of interest and displays the respective entries in table and on a map. Users can enter their home address and the app calculates the distance to each location and displays the home on the map as well. I&#8217;ve realized the guide using R, mostly using shiny and leaflet.
