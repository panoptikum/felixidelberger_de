In my [master thesis](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y5j2u) I analyzed the parliament speeches given in the German State parliaments between 2008 and 2018. The time period covered varies between the states. My python code that converts the speeches into a machine-readable format is publicly [available][1]. I've have create a [dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/370V8H) where you can download the scraped speeches and interjections.
